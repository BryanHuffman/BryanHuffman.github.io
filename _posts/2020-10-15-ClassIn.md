Question 1: How does Owen Barder define development? How does this extend Amartya Sen's definition to include the idea of complexity?

  > *test*

Question 2: Who was Thomas Thwaites and what was his "toaster project"? Was he successful? What is the significance of this example in the context of Barder's talk about complexity and development?

  > *test*

Question 3: Barder compared the economic growth of South Korea and Ghana between 1960 and 2010. Why was this example instructive as part of his talk? What did this comparison demonstrate when used as a basis to validate (or invalidate) economic models?

Question 4: What was the Harrod-Domar model? What are the two fundamental variables in this model? Who was Walter Rostow and what the impact of his work on development?  Was the Harrod-Domar model effective at predicting development outcomes?

  > The Harrod-Domar model is a method of determining economic growth. It relies on evaluating output by considering both factors of labor and capital. Was introduced shortly after World War II, and would be proven inaccurate. Walter Rostow extended the previous model by replacing labor with evaluations of income, growth, savings, and investment, but this was still unable to describe the complexity of economic growth. Unfortunately, this model was used to predict foreign aid, and reduced development to a dollar value which obfuscates human beings.

Question 5: What was the Robert Solow model and how did it address the limitations of the Harrod-Domar model? Was this model successful as predicting economic growth?
